# Fish-Species-Detection
Fish species identification is vital for biodiversity and fisheries management. This project uses deep learning with the VGG16 model to accurately classify fish from images and offers a web interface for easy use, aiding researchers in efficient species detection and conservation.

I have trained the model and tested it myself throughout my fish dataset which i acquired through a website called kaggle.
You can download it and use it to train the model
